# Assignment 4: SQL part 2

Consider our good old University Schema that we’ve been using in class. Here is the Schema once again:

    Student(sID, surName, firstName, campus, email, cgpa)
    Course(Dept, cNum, name, breadth)
    Offering(oID, dept, cNum, term, instructor)
    Took(sID, oID, grade)

Student is a Relation that captures the students in the university. Each student has a unique student ID sID,

    sID: the unique student ID
    surName: the surname of the student
    firstName: the first name of the student
    campus: the campus of the student
    email: the email address of the student
    cgpa: the CGPA of the student

Course is a Relation that captures the courses offered by the university. Each course has a unique combination of Dept and cNum, where Dept is the department code and cNum is the course number,

    Dept: the department code
    cNum: the course number
    name: the name of the course
    breadth: the breadth requirement that the course satisfies

Offering is a Relation that captures the offerings of courses in a given term. Each offering has a unique offering ID oID, and is associated with a course (Dept, cNum) and a term,

    oID: the unique offering ID
    dept: the department code
    cNum: the course number
    term: the term in which the course is offered
    instructor: the instructor teaching the course

Took is a Relation that captures the courses that students have taken. Each Took tuple has a unique combination of sID and oID, where sID is the student ID and oID is the offering ID, and also has a grade,

    sID: the student ID
    oID: the offering ID
    grade: the grade that the student got in the course

### (a) Provide a list of all students (using their sID) and the number of courses that they took.

```sql
SELECT sID, COUNT(oID) AS NumberOfCourses
FROM university.Took
GROUP BY sID;
```

### (b) Provide a list of all students (using their sID) who took at least two courses with instructor Horton.

```sql
SELECT sID
FROM university.Took
WHERE oID IN (
    SELECT oID
    FROM university.Offering
    WHERE instructor = 'Horton'
)
GROUP BY sID
HAVING COUNT(oID) >= 2;
```

```sql
SELECT sID
FROM university.Took JOIN university.Offering ON Took.oID = Offering.oID
WHERE instructor = 'Horton'
GROUP BY sID
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Took.oID) >= 2;
```

### (c) Provide a list of all students who did not take any courses with instructor Horton.

```sql
SELECT sID
FROM university.Student
WHERE sID NOT IN (
    SELECT sID
    FROM university.Took
    WHERE oID IN (
        SELECT oID
        FROM university.Offering
        WHERE instructor = 'Horton'
    )
);
```

```sql
SELECT sID
FROM university.Student
WHERE sID NOT IN (
    SELECT sID
    FROM university.Took JOIN university.Offering ON Took.oID = Offering.oID
    WHERE instructor = 'Horton'
);
```

### (d) Find the name of the course in which student “Homer Simpson” got his best (highest) grade.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM university.Course
WHERE (Dept, cNum) IN (
    SELECT dept, cNum
    FROM university.Offering
    WHERE oID IN (
        SELECT oID
        FROM university.Took
        WHERE sID = (
            SELECT sID
            FROM university.Student
            WHERE firstName = 'Homer' AND surName = 'Simpson'
        )
        ORDER BY grade DESC
        LIMIT 1
    )
);

```

```sql
SELECT C.name
FROM university.Course C
JOIN university.Offering O ON C.Dept = O.dept AND C.cNum = O.cNum
JOIN university.Took T ON O.oID = T.oID
WHERE T.sID = (
    SELECT sID
    FROM university.Student
    WHERE firstName = 'Homer' AND surName = 'Simpson'
)
ORDER BY T.grade DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

```sql
SELECT name
FROM university.Course JOIN university.Offering ON Course.Dept = Offering.dept AND Course.cNum = Offering.cNum
JOIN university.Took ON Offering.oID = Took.oID
JOIN university.Student ON Took.sID = Student.sID
WHERE surName = 'Simpson' AND firstName = 'Homer'
ORDER BY grade DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### (e) Let’s find out which instructors are the easy graders! Provide a list that has, for each instructor, their name and the average grade of all students in all their offerings. But only show those instructors where the average is at least 80.

```sql
SELECT instructor, AVG(grade)
FROM university.Student, university.Offering, university.Took
WHERE Student.sID = Took.sID AND Offering.oID = Took.oID
GROUP BY instructor
HAVING AVG(grade) >= 80;
```

```sql
SELECT O.instructor, AVG(T.grade)
FROM university.Offering O
JOIN university.Took T ON O.oID = T.oID
GROUP BY O.instructor
HAVING AVG(T.grade) >= 80;


```

### (f) Let’s find the most popular instructor(s)! Find the instructor(s) who has (have) the largest number of students across all of their offerings. In case of a tie (multiple instructors having the same largest number of students), all instructors among the tie should be returned.

```sql
SELECT s.firstName, s.surName, COUNT(s.sID) AS numStudents
FROM university.Student s
JOIN university.Took t ON s.sID = t.sID
JOIN university.Offering o ON o.oID = t.oID
GROUP BY s.firstName, s.surName
HAVING numStudents = (
    SELECT MAX(numStudents)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(s.sID) AS numStudents
        FROM university.Student s
        JOIN university.Took t ON s.sID = t.sID
        JOIN university.Offering o ON o.oID = t.oID
        GROUP BY s.firstName, s.surName
    ) AS subquery
);
```

```sql
WITH InstructorCount AS (
    SELECT instructor, COUNT(DISTINCT sID) AS studentCount
    FROM university.Offering JOIN university.Took ON Offering.oID = Took.oID
    GROUP BY instructor
)
SELECT instructor
FROM InstructorCount
WHERE studentCount = (SELECT MAX(studentCount) FROM InstructorCount);
```

### (g) You’re looking to hire students for a database-related research project. Provide a list that has, for each student (sID), their grade in the course CSC343. Students who did not take this course should still appear in this list, but should have a null value for their grade.

```sql
SELECT Student.sID, Results.grade
FROM university.Student LEFT JOIN (
SELECT AllStudents.sID, AllStudents.grade
FROM (
SELECT Student.sID, Took.oID, Took.grade
FROM university.Student JOIN university.Took
ON Student.sID = Took.sID
) AS AllStudents
JOIN university.Offering ON AllStudents.oID = Offering.oID
WHERE Offering.dept='CSC' AND Offering.cNum = '343'
) AS Results
ON Student.sID = Results.sID;

```
