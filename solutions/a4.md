# Assignment 4: SQL part 2

Consider our good old University Schema that we’ve been using in class. Here is the Schema once again:

    Student(sID, surName, firstName, campus, email, cgpa)
    Course(Dept, cNum, name, breadth)
    Offering(oID, dept, cNum, term, instructor)
    Took(sID, oID, grade)

Student is a Relation that captures the students in the university. Each student has a unique student ID sID,

    sID: the unique student ID
    surName: the surname of the student
    firstName: the first name of the student
    campus: the campus of the student
    email: the email address of the student
    cgpa: the CGPA of the student

Course is a Relation that captures the courses offered by the university. Each course has a unique combination of Dept and cNum, where Dept is the department code and cNum is the course number,

    Dept: the department code
    cNum: the course number
    name: the name of the course
    breadth: the breadth requirement that the course satisfies

Offering is a Relation that captures the offerings of courses in a given term. Each offering has a unique offering ID oID, and is associated with a course (Dept, cNum) and a term,

    oID: the unique offering ID
    dept: the department code
    cNum: the course number
    term: the term in which the course is offered
    instructor: the instructor teaching the course

Took is a Relation that captures the courses that students have taken. Each Took tuple has a unique combination of sID and oID, where sID is the student ID and oID is the offering ID, and also has a grade,

    sID: the student ID
    oID: the offering ID
    grade: the grade that the student got in the course

### (a) Provide a list of all students (using their sID) and the number of courses that they took.

```sql
SELECT sID, COUNT(oID) AS numCourses
FROM university.Took
GROUP BY sID;
```

### (b) Provide a list of all students (using their sID) who took at least two courses with instructor Horton.

```sql
SELECT sID
FROM university.Took
WHERE oID IN (
    SELECT oID
    FROM university.Offering
    WHERE instructor = 'Horton'
)
GROUP BY sID
HAVING COUNT(oID) >= 2;
```

### (c) Provide a list of all students who did not take any courses with instructor Horton.

```sql
SELECT sID
FROM university.Student
WHERE sID NOT IN (
    SELECT sID
    FROM university.Took
    WHERE oID IN (
        SELECT oID
        FROM university.Offering
        WHERE instructor = 'Horton'
    )
);
```

### (d) Find the name of the course in which student “Homer Simpson” got his best (highest) grade.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM university.Course
WHERE (Dept, cNum) IN (
    SELECT dept, cNum
    FROM university.Offering
    WHERE oID IN (
        SELECT oID
        FROM university.Took
        WHERE sID = (
            SELECT sID
            FROM university.Student
            WHERE firstName = 'Homer' AND surName = 'Simpson'
        )
    )
)
ORDER BY name DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT C.name
FROM university.Course C
JOIN university.Offering O ON C.Dept = O.dept AND C.cNum = O.cNum
JOIN university.Took T ON O.oID = T.oID
WHERE T.sID = (
    SELECT sID
    FROM university.Student
    WHERE firstName = 'Homer' AND surName = 'Simpson'
)
ORDER BY T.grade DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

### (e) Let’s find out which instructors are the easy graders! Provide a list that has, for each instructor, their name and the average grade of all students in all their offerings. But only show those instructors where the average is at least 80.

```sql
SELECT firstName, surName, AVG(grade) AS avgGrade
FROM university.Student, university.Offering, university.Took
WHERE Student.sID = Took.sID AND Offering.oID = Took.oID
GROUP BY firstName, surName
HAVING AVG(grade) >= 80;

SELECT s.firstName, s.surName, AVG(t.grade) AS avgGrade
FROM university.Student s
JOIN university.Took t ON s.sID = t.sID
JOIN university.Offering o ON o.oID = t.oID
GROUP BY s.firstName, s.surName
HAVING AVG(t.grade) >= 80;

SELECT O.instructor, AVG(T.grade) AS avgGrade
FROM university.Offering O
JOIN university.Took T ON O.oID = T.oID
GROUP BY O.instructor
HAVING AVG(T.grade) >= 80;


```

### (f) Let’s find the most popular instructor(s)! Find the instructor(s) who has (have) the largest number of students across all of their offerings. In case of a tie (multiple instructors having the same largest number of students), all instructors among the tie should be returned.

```sql
SELECT s.firstName, s.surName, COUNT(s.sID) AS numStudents
FROM university.Student s
JOIN university.Took t ON s.sID = t.sID
JOIN university.Offering o ON o.oID = t.oID
GROUP BY s.firstName, s.surName
HAVING numStudents = (
    SELECT MAX(numStudents)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(s.sID) AS numStudents
        FROM university.Student s
        JOIN university.Took t ON s.sID = t.sID
        JOIN university.Offering o ON o.oID = t.oID
        GROUP BY s.firstName, s.surName
    ) AS subquery
);

WITH InstructorCounts AS (
    SELECT o.instructor, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sID) AS numStudents
    FROM university.Offering o
    JOIN university.Took t ON o.oID = t.oID
    GROUP BY o.instructor
)

SELECT instructor, numStudents
FROM InstructorCounts
WHERE numStudents = (
    SELECT MAX(numStudents) FROM InstructorCounts
);


```

### (g) You’re looking to hire students for a database-related research project. Provide a list that has, for each student (sID), their grade in the course CSC343. Students who did not take this course should still appear in this list, but should have a null value for their grade.

```sql
SELECT sID, grade
FROM university.Took
WHERE oID = (
    SELECT oID
    FROM university.Offering
    WHERE dept = 'CSC' AND cNum = 343
);
```
